# FLAME Framework Requirements

## Executive Summary

FLAME is approximately 40% complete with solid foundations but critical missing pieces preventing actual usage for training. The primary blockers are incomplete backward pass implementations, Arc double-wrapping issues, and missing autograd integration.

## Critical Missing Features (Priority 1 - Must Fix)

### 1. Backward Pass Implementations (1-2 weeks)
**Issue**: Most operations have forward-only implementations
**Required**:
- Conv2D backward pass (kernel exists but not integrated)
- Linear layer backward pass
- Attention mechanism backward pass
- Pooling layers backward pass (MaxPool2d, AvgPool2d)
- Activation functions backward pass (ReLU, GELU, SiLU)
- Normalization backward pass (LayerNorm, RMSNorm, GroupNorm)

**Effort**: 5-7 days for core operations, 3-5 days for testing/validation

### 2. Arc Double-Wrapping Fix (2-3 days)
**Issue**: Test code expects `Arc<CudaDevice>` but receives `Arc<Arc<CudaDevice>>`
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent device management between library and test code
**Required**:
- Standardize device handling across all modules
- Fix all 58 compilation errors related to Arc wrapping
- Update test infrastructure to match library expectations

**Effort**: 2 days for fixes, 1 day for validation

### 3. Import and Module Visibility (1-2 days)
**Issue**: Missing imports in test modules preventing compilation
**Required**:
```rust
// Add to all test modules
use std::sync::Arc;
use crate::{Shape, CudaDevice};
use cudarc::driver::LaunchAsync;
```
- Proper re-exports in lib.rs
- Implement prelude pattern for common imports
- Fix module visibility for test access

**Effort**: 1-2 days

## API Fixes Needed (Priority 2)

### 1. Unified Autograd System (3-5 days)
**Issue**: Three different autograd implementations (v1, v2, v3) with no clear winner
**Required**:
- Choose and consolidate to single autograd implementation
- Complete gradient tracking integration
- Connect autograd to all operations
- Implement proper gradient accumulation

**Effort**: 3-5 days

### 2. Tensor Operation Completeness (2-3 days)
**Issue**: Many tensor operations incomplete or missing backward
**Required**:
- Complete all basic math operations (add, sub, mul, div, pow)
- Implement reduction operations (sum, mean, max, min)
- Add broadcasting support for all operations
- Implement view operations (reshape, transpose, permute)

**Effort**: 2-3 days

### 3. Memory Management Integration (2-3 days)
**Issue**: Memory pools exist but aren't used by tensor operations
**Required**:
- Connect CUDA memory pools to tensor allocation
- Implement proper memory recycling
- Add memory profiling hooks
- Fix memory leaks in gradient computation

**Effort**: 2-3 days

## Backward Pass Implementations Required (Priority 1)

### 1. Conv2D Backward (2 days)
- Gradient w.r.t input
- Gradient w.r.t weight
- Gradient w.r.t bias
- Integration with existing CUDA kernels

### 2. Linear/Dense Backward (1 day)
- Matrix multiplication gradients
- Bias gradient computation
- Efficient CUDA implementation

### 3. Attention Backward (2-3 days)
- Multi-head attention gradients
- Flash attention backward pass
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Support for causal masks

### 4. Normalization Backward (2 days)
- LayerNorm backward
- RMSNorm backward
- GroupNorm backward
- BatchNorm backward (if needed)

### 5. Activation Backward (1 day)
- ReLU, GELU, SiLU gradients
- In-place optimization
- Fused kernel implementations

## Integration Issues to Resolve (Priority 3)

### 1. EriDiffusion Integration (3-4 days)
**Issue**: Adapter incomplete, no clear integration path
**Required**:
- Complete FLAME adapter for EriDiffusion
- Implement model loading/saving
- Add checkpoint compatibility
- Create migration guide

**Effort**: 3-4 days

### 2. Model-Specific Implementations (1 week)
**Issue**: Model blocks (Flux, MMDiT, SDXL) not fully connected
**Required**:
- Complete Flux block implementations
- Finish MMDiT architecture
- Implement SDXL U-Net blocks
- Add proper forward/backward for all

**Effort**: 1 week

### 3. Training Infrastructure (3-4 days)
**Issue**: No complete training loop example
**Required**:
- Implement full training loop
- Add gradient accumulation
- Implement learning rate scheduling
- Add validation/evaluation hooks

**Effort**: 3-4 days

## Priority Order for Implementation

## Estimated Effort Summary

| Component | Priority | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Arc Double-Wrapping Fix | Critical | 2-3 days | None |
| Import/Visibility Fixes | Critical | 1-2 days | None |
| Backward Pass Core Ops | Critical | 5-7 days | Arc fixes |
| Autograd Consolidation | High | 3-5 days | Import fixes |
| Tensor Op Completeness | High | 2-3 days | Autograd |
| Memory Integration | Medium | 2-3 days | Tensor ops |
| EriDiffusion Adapter | Medium | 3-4 days | All core fixes |
| Model Implementations | Medium | 5-7 days | Backward passes |
| Training Infrastructure | Low | 3-4 days | Everything above |

**Total Estimated Effort**: 3-5 weeks for production-ready framework

## Success Criteria

1. **All tests compile and pass** (currently 0/50+ compile)
2. **Complete autograd** for all operations
3. **Training example** that actually trains a small model
4. **Memory efficient** - no leaks, proper pooling
5. **Performance parity** with PyTorch for common operations
6. **Full integration** with EriDiffusion for real model training

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Consolidate duplicate implementations
   - Remove dead code (79 warnings)
   - Fix naming conventions (snake_case)

2. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for all public methods
   - Usage examples for each component
   - Migration guide from PyTorch

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all operations
   - Integration tests for training
   - Performance benchmarks

## Risk Factors

1. **CUDA Kernel Complexity**: Some backward passes may require complex CUDA kernels
2. **Memory Management**: Proper gradient accumulation without memory leaks
3. **Numerical Stability**: Ensuring gradients are computed accurately
4. **Performance**: Achieving competitive performance with PyTorch

## Conclusion

FLAME has solid foundations with CUDA integration, memory management, and forward passes mostly complete. However, it requires 3-5 weeks of focused development to become usable for training. The critical path is:

1. Fix compilation errors (2-3 days)
2. Implement backward passes (1-2 weeks)
3. Integrate components (1 week)
4. Optimize and polish (1-2 weeks)

The framework shows promise but needs significant work to fulfill its purpose as a training framework for diffusion models.
