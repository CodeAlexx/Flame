# FLAME Framework Status

## âœ… What's Working

### Core Compilation
- FLAME core library compiles successfully
- All CUDA kernels compile via NVRTC
- No more PTX inline assembly issues

### Tensor Operations
All basic tensor operations are functional:
- Creation: `zeros`, `ones`, `randn`, `from_vec`
- Arithmetic: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`
- Scalar ops: `add_scalar`, `mul_scalar`
- Activations: `relu`, `sigmoid`, `tanh`, `gelu`, `silu`
- Matrix operations: `matmul`, `transpose`
- Reductions: `sum`, `mean`
- Utility: `clone`, `to_vec_f32`

### CUDA Integration
- GPU memory management working
- NVRTC kernel compilation working
- Kernel execution verified
- No CPU fallbacks (GPU-only as required)

### Training Support
FLAME has the infrastructure for training that Candle lacks:
- `requires_grad` flag on tensors
- Autograd engine (though API needs work)
- Gradient storage system
- Manual gradient computation works

## ðŸš§ What Needs Work

### Autograd API
- The `backward()` method exists but needs proper integration
- Currently requires manual gradient computation
- AutogradEngine needs to be properly exposed

### Missing Operations
- Convolution operations need GPU kernels
- Upsampling/pooling need GPU implementations
- Batch normalization needs implementation

### Integration
- Need to migrate actual model code to use FLAME
- Weight loading from Candle models needs testing
- Full training loop integration pending

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Fix Autograd API** - Make `backward()` work without manual engine management
2. **Implement Conv2D GPU kernels** - Essential for CNN models
3. **Migrate a simple model** - Start with a basic feedforward network
4. **Test weight loading** - Ensure we can load pretrained Candle weights
5. **Full training test** - Implement a complete training loop with autograd

## ðŸ’¡ Key Advantages Over Candle

1. **True gradient support** - FLAME has `requires_grad` and autograd infrastructure
2. **Training capability** - Can compute gradients and update weights
3. **GPU-only design** - No CPU fallback overhead
4. **Custom kernels** - NVRTC allows runtime kernel compilation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- Uses cudarc for CUDA bindings
- NVRTC for runtime kernel compilation
- Arc-based tensor memory management
- Separate gradient storage to avoid borrow checker issues
- GPU-only by design (no CPU fallbacks)
